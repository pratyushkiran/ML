# Roadmap to Machine Learning (ML)

1. Maths 
   - Linear Algebra (Matrix, Vector)
   - Statistics
   - Probability

2. Learn Python & its Libraries
   - Numpy
   - Pandas

3. Learn ML Algorithms 
   - Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement 
   - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering
   - KNN (K Nearest Neighbours)
   - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Overfitting, Underfitting
   - Regularization, Gradient Descent, Slope
   - Confusion Matrix

4. Data Preprocessing (for higher accuracy)
   - Handling Null Values
   - Standardization
   - Handling Categorical Values
   - One-Hot Encoding
   - Feature Scaling

5. Learn ML libraries 
   - Scikit learn
   - Matplotlib
   - Tensorflow for DL

6. Practice, Practice, Practice (Kaggle)
